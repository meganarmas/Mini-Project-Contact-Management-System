How to use this application:

Welcome to the Contact Management System program! This program can be used to find managed contacts. On the menu, users can choose from these tasks: 

1. Add a new contact
2. Edit an existing contact
3. Delete a contact
4. Search for a contact
5. Display all contacts
6. Export contacts to a text file
7. Import contacts from a text file
8. Quit

Users will need to input a number between 1 - 8 in order to get to which application they would like to use. If a user would like to add a new contact, input '1'. For editing an exisiting contact, enter '2'. You will be prompted into searching for the contact by their name. Once the contact is found from their name, a prompt will appear asking what you could like to change; name, phone number, email, or additional information.

To delete a contact, type in '3'. You will need their name in order to delete the contact, but once found, it will delete.

To search for a contact, type and '4' and look them up via their email address. If the email address is in the dictionary, the program will find it. For displaying all contacts, type '5'.

To export and import contacts, type in '6' and '7' respectively. The text files are already included in this program with export_file.txt and import_contacts.txt.

By hitting '8' for quit, you will exit out of the program.
